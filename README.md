# PSXU
PSXU is a single-file PHP script to upload files on your webserver through Sharex for quick sharing.

There are already a couple solutions like this, but they have a fair bit many more features than I'd like, and require some more setup.

PSXU was made with the following in mind:
- It receives a file through Sharex, and returns a URL to the file.
- If it fails, it clearly says why.
- It can be installed in under 5 minutes by anyone who can follow written instructions.

If this is all you seek and no more, PSXU might be what you seek.

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for setting up PSXU are available in https://markski.ar/blog/sharex-self-host-with-psxu
